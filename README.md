# Asset-Portfolio-Generator
We created an application that when l open the app, I am presented with a selection of conservative, balanced or aggressive risk tolerance options;
If l know my risk tolerance, I select an option that aligns with my risk tolerance and l am presented with stocks that align my risk profile; 
If l donâ€™t know my risk profile, I select the option to participate in a quiz that is designed to determine my risk tolerance based on a set of carefully selected questions and a set algorithm; 
Once my risk tolerance is determined from quiz, I am presented with a selection of stocks that align my risk profile;
When l click on each stock suggestion, I am presented with top news stories about my recommended stocks;

We used the Materialize css framework, yahoo finance API and news API for the stock news articles

We had exposure to different github functions as we created issues and assigned them to make sure workflow was suitable and the job was completed on time by using the projects function.

Pull requests were also used by us for the first time as we had a number of different branches that we needed to merge into master without causing any integration problems
